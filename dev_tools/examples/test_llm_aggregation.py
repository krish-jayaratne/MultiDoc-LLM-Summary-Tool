üìà OLD ALGORITHMIC APPROACH:
   ‚Ä¢ Sentence-level deduplication with exact/similarity matching
   ‚Ä¢ Keyword-based importance scoring with manual weights
   ‚Ä¢ Character-based truncation (often cuts mid-sentence)
   ‚Ä¢ Rule-based logic that misses context

ü§ñ NEW LLM APPROACH:
   ‚Ä¢ Semantic understanding of content relationships
   ‚Ä¢ Natural language generation for flowing summaries
   ‚Ä¢ Intelligent content selection based on overall meaning
   ‚Ä¢ Fallback to simple concatenation if LLM fails

üí∞ COST CONSIDERATION:
   ‚Ä¢ Each aggregation call uses ~100-300 tokens
   ‚Ä¢ For large documents with 5 chunks: ~5 aggregation calls
   ‚Ä¢ Small additional cost for significantly better quality
